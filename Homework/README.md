# DATA601 (Fall 2022)
Instructor: Felix Gonzalez
Grader: Krishna Sai Biradar

Homework and Projects:

There will be homework assigned to students roughly every two weeks. Depending on the scale of the homework, students will be given one or two weeks to submit their homework and other than exceptional circumstances this homework will be graded within a week. 

Please return your solution notebooks to the Grader and Instructor via Blackboard. Modify the homework solution notebook file as follow: Lastname_HWXY.ipynb (e.g. Gonzalez_HW02.ipynb). If there is someone with the same last-name in the class, please add the initial of your first name between your last name and HWXY.


Alternative Approach: Create a private Github repository and provide access to Instructor (fgonzale@umbc.edu) and Grader. Use the private repository to upload the .ipynb file with your completed homework. Send the link to the .ipynb file to the instructor and grader via Blackboard.

Due Dates:

HW 1 - September 26.
